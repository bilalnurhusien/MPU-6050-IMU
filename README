This is a simple demo of a MPU-6050 IMU using a Nokia 5110 LCD display and Arduino Uno. The code was heavily borrowed
from work done by http://www.brokking.net/imu.html. Only refactored the code and modified it to work with a Nokia 5110
LCD and display temperature. Requires the Adafruit PCD8544 and GFX libraries to compile.
